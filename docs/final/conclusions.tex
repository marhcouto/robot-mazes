\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    
    The results show that our admissible heuristics found the ideal solution considering our criteria but the non admissible heuristics found a solution in less iterations. In this case the greedy algorithm was the best algorithm because it yielded the best solution in less time and iterations when compared to other algorithms
    
    The project was a success as we were able to
    \begin{itemize}
        \item create a representation of the problem as a search problem
        \item build algorithms capable of solving it and heuristics to aid them
        \item build an environment to test and showcase the algorithms 
        \item analyze the results and understand the differences 
    \end{itemize}
