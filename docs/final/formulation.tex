    \textbf{State Representation:} With N being the number of moves allowed, state S is an array of size N of the movements chosen. \\
    \textbf{Initial State:} A random state. E.g. S = [Right,Up,Left,Down] \\
    \textbf{Objective Test:} The cycle of movements of the given state, repeated indefinitely, always changes position after an iteration and eventually reaches the goal spot. \\
    \textbf{Operators:}
    \begin{table}
        \begin{tabular}{l l l l}
            \toprule
            \textbf{Operator} & \textbf{Pre-Condition} & \textbf{Effect} & \textbf{Cost} \\
            \midrule
            ChangeMov(i,m)  & $ i >= 0 \land i < N \land S[i] \neq m $ & $S[i] = m $  & 1 \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Operators}
    \end{table}
    
    With this approach, we consider every solution to be equally optimal, being the speed of the algorithm the desirable aspect to optimize.
