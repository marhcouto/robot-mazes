    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Breadth-First Search (BFS)} 
        \item \textbf{Depth-First Search (DFS)}
        \item \textbf{Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)}
        \item \textbf{Greedy Search}
        \item \textbf{A* algorithm}
    
    \end{itemize}
    
    As the cost of our operators is 1, \textbf{Uniform Cost Search} is equivalent to \textbf{Breadth-First Search}
    
    We did not give any limit in depth for either \textbf{Depth-First Search} or \textbf{Iterative Deepening Search}, as there is always a solution and we do not allow for repeated nodes/states.
